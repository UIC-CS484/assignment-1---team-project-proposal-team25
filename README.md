Workflow strategy:
-Created two branches, main and dev, where main is the 'production' branch, and dev is where most of the drafts take place.
      Most of my work was locally done so I did not utilize these branches much this project
      
-My general responsibilites: Meeting all the requirements of Assignment 1
